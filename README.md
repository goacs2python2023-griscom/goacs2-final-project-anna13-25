Hi! My name is Anna and this is my catalyst project.
## What can impact oneâ€™s creativity? And how can that affect their performance in school?

 I mainly chose this question because I am a very creative person, and have been around other very different creative people, and I had always wondered how creativity really impacted people, or what it even was scientfically. 

 Through my research, I found an experiment by Drexel University on jazz solo improvisations. In the experiment, they mapped brain pathways and which parts of the brain were being used while the people were soloing. I used some of their findings and plotted them out on a scatterplot to show the p-value(probably of creativity) and log-likelihood(the goodness-of-fit measure). 

 I also found a study done by Gallup that assessed student's creativity and applied that to various school-related topics. I found the some of the most interesting to me and graphed this in a bar graph to show the differences between different topics in students. 

 I really enjoyed creating these graphs as well as learning more about creativity in people and hope that this presents the impact of this through my project.
